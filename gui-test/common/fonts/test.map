#summary These are the changes in version 0.2
#labels Phase-Support

The following additions and changes have been made:

  * Removed the built-in font - now *requires* DLDI patching
  * Escaping of forms and urls. Now urls with "&amp;" should work as expected.
  * Parsing of .. in urls. So href="../whatever" will work
  * Added history - left and right go forwards and backwards.
  * POST form handling added.
  * Long lines wrap
  * Spaces added to keyboard - allowing multi-word searches on Google.
  * Password fields added - though without text fields and a full keyboard they are a bit useless...
  * Highlight link when touched.
  * Cookies added - uses a whitelist of allowed cookies, all others are refused. _Empty_ default whitelist for cookies stored in /data/bunjalloo/user/ckallow.lst
  * Configuration file added, to allow for (future) customisation.
  * Allow "file:" to "http:" URL navigation, but not the other way around.
  * Updated dswifi to 0.3.2 to fix problems on newer DS lites.

Version 0.2.1 is a bug fix release. The only difference to 0.2 is a fix for [http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/issues/detail?id=1&can=1 Supercard CF compatibility]. If you have tested it successfully on a Supercard CF, please take the time to add a comment to [http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/issues/detail?id=1&can=1 Issue 1], or to this wiki page.

#labels Phase-Support,Featured

==Installation==
===Version 0.1===
~~Bunjalloo v0.1~~ (Deprecated) uses [http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/ DLDI] for viewing local files (those with a file:/ URL) only. To view remote http:/ URLs, no patching is required. Bunjalloo can be run using Wireless Multiboot, without an attached cartridge.

===Version 0.2+===
[BunjallooChangelog0dot2 Bunjalloo v0.2] and upwards requires [http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/ DLDI] patching. The steps to install are:

  * Unzip the [http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list downloaded zip file].
  * Patch bunjalloo.nds with the [http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/ DLDI] tool.
  * Copy bunjalloo.nds and the data/ directory to the root of your flash card.

DLDI is needed becuase the font files are no longer encrusted into the
binary. Instead they are read from the slot-1 media. Your flash card should have the
following directory structure:
{{{
/
|-- bunjalloo.nds
`-- data/
    `-- bunjalloo
        |-- config.ini
        |-- docs
        |   |-- copying
        |   `-- warranty
        `-- fonts
            |-- vera.img
            |-- vera.map
            `-- vera.pal
}}}
The distribution zip file already contains these folders. Unzipping it to the
root folder of the flash card should create the appropriate structure.

==Controls==
||*Action*||What it does||
||*Start*||Enter a URL (show keyboard)||
||*Up/Down*||Scroll screen up and down||
||*Right*||Move forwards in the history||
||*Left*||Move backwards in the history||
||*Touch*||Follow link, enter data in forms, press keys||

== What is Bunjalloo? ==
Bunjalloo is a HTTP user agent (web browser) for the Nintendo DS. It has been implemented from scratch using [http://www.whatwg.org/ the whatwg user agent design rules].

http://quirkysoft.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshots/bunjalloo-ds.png

==Availability==  
Bunjalloo is freely available under the GNU General Public License 2.0. See COPYRIGHT and http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/ for further details. Bunjalloo can be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list download section] of this site.

====Changing the font====
Not available in 0.1. If you want to use a different font, then you will need the contents of the
[http://quirkysoft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bunjalloo/tools/ bunjalloo/tools] directory.
Run the convert.sh script passing the True Type Font name and the point size desired. It should generate 3 files, the raw image data, the palette and the mappings. Copy these into the /data/bunjalloo/fonts directory.

To add extra ranges of UTF-8 glyphs, then *all* the ranges required must be
passed on the command line after the size. By default the glyphs included are:
{{{
0x1f,0x7f 0xa0,0x100 0x20AC,0x20AD 8211,8212 8216,8218 8220,8221 8226,8226
}}}
These are used if no ranges are given.  Here 0x1f,0x7f means "the range 0x1f (31)
to 0x7f (127) inclusive". This covers all ASCII characters, the extra latin ones
(accented a's and e's, etc) and some common symbols - the Euro sign, copyright and
so on.

The font name is defined in _/data/bunjalloo/config.ini_. Change the line
`font=fonts/vera` to indicate the basename of the new font. For
example, to generate a new 12 point font from the font MyFont.ttf, one could do
this:
{{{
./convert.sh MyFont.ttf 12
cp myfont.* /media/disk/data/bunjalloo/fonts/
sed -i 's/vera/myfont/' /media/disk/data/bunjalloo/config.ini
}}}
The output font name is always all-lowercase.

These screenshots show the main screen. The sub screen was empty in this version. In version 3.0, the top screen is used to show details on the currently selected spell.

== Installation ==
Copy either ChaosDS.nds or ChaosDS.ds.gba to your development cartridge. It
doesn't use the media at all, everything is linked in to the binary, so no DLDI
patches are required. Run the game using your cartridge's shell.

The ChaosDS.nds file has also been tested using
[http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/wifi_apps.php WMB for Linux]. It may also work
with WMB for Windows but I haven't been able to test it.﻿#summary Help for compiling the source code.

== About Bunjalloo ==

[http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3Abunjalloo download]. The code builds for the DS or Linux/SDL and since the DS version doesn't run on any emulators here is a screenshot from the SDL version:

Up to 8 wizards compete in a turn-based battle to the death, involving elves, dragons, fire, lightning and the odd Gooey Blob. The last wizard standing is the winner.

Chaos is a tactical combat video game for the Nitendo DS based on the 1985 Spectrum game 'Chaos - The Battle of Wizards'. Originally remade for the Gameboy Advance, this version has been rewritten once more from the ground up.
